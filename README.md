# Rain Prediction

## Project Description

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of rain the following day, using weather data from across Australia. The target variable is `RainTomorrow`, which indicates whether it will rain tomorrow (`Yes` or `No`). 

Using machine learning techniques, we aim to predict the likelihood of rain based on various weather attributes like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Source**: [Weather Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)
- **Data Overview**:
  - The dataset contains daily weather observations from Australia over 10 years.
  - Key features include:
    - Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Pressure, etc.
  - **Target variable**: `RainTomorrow` (Yes/No) indicating whether it will rain the next day.

## Files

- `rain-prediction-notebook.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for predicting rainfall. It includes steps for exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training and evaluation 
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies needed to run the project.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git (e.g., temporary files, virtual environment directories).

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Rain-Prediction.git
